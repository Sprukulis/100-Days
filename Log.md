Day 1: October 1, 2017 (Start)


Today's Progress: Did learn  Github on Treehouse.

Thoughts: I struggled with my brain as I started late. Tomorrow I will start sooner in the day (Sundays are hard to start with) 

Day 2: October 2, 2017

Today's Progress: Treehouse python course :)

Thoughts: need to do a bit more code academy to get the basics right :) Good idea for tomorrow.


Day 3: October 3, 2017

Today's Progress: Did spend 1h in codeacademy. Was refreshing.

Thoughts: Seems that splitting up the learning in smaler chunks will be more productive as after 40 min the brain starts to loose focus.
